General Process
Raw Data --(Clean)--> Tidy Data --(Analysis)--> Useful Data

4 Things you should have:
1. Raw Data
2. Tidy Data
3. Code book
	Index + description of variables and units
	study design and how the data was collected
4. Explicit instructions 
	re: how 1 became 2, 3 
	[R/Python Script]
	No parameters in script


Getting and setting working directory:
Should be in the script
setwd() and getwd() commands
can be relative or absolute

sedwd("./data") 
"../" [move up one directory] as well is possible
abolute file paths as well
note that in windows
to get the a single backslash -> double backslash is required

ex. setwd("C:\\Users\\...")

file.exists("directoryName") -> boolean
checks to see if directory exists [files as well?]
dir.create("directoryName") -> create a directory if it does not exist

ex: if(!file.exists("data")){
	dir.create("data")
}

download.file()
params: url, destfile, method

read.table()
params: file, header, sep, row.names, nrows

Notes regarding excel file [xlsx library]
write.xlsx outputs excel file from R
read.xlsx2 much faster than read.xlsx [but can be unstable]
XLConnect is better if much heavier work in Excel file format -
for ease of use though save as csv or .tab/.txt due to proprietary constraints

Data Table
Inherits from Dataframe
-> native C implementation so much faster
